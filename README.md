#A super-easy Underscore.js rewriting

trattinoBasso.js (the italian translation for underscore) is a rewriting of the great Underscore.js library. 

The aim of this is first of all to exercise: it's not meant (quite obviously) to be a competitor or to be really useful, it just want to be a challenge for myself, a way to improve my skills and my confidence with JS.

So, if you are landed in this poor little repo and you want to spend some of your time reviewing my work: well, you are welcome and i'd really appreciate it :)
